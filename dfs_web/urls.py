"""
Client-facing surface: the React SPA only.

- /admin/          Django admin (internal/staff tool, not a client UI)
- /api/...         JSON API consumed by the SPA (and nothing else)
- /billing/webhook/razorpay/   server-to-server Razorpay callback, not a page
- everything else  falls through to the built SPA (frontend/dist/index.html)
                    so React Router can handle client-side routes like
                    /cases/42 directly, including on a hard refresh.

The old server-rendered template views (cases/evidence/billing/accounts/
dashboard/auditlog "views.py") have been removed -- they were an earlier,
parallel implementation of the same features that the API + SPA superseded.
Keeping both around risked the two UIs drifting out of sync with each
other's permission/limit logic, so there is now exactly one client surface.
